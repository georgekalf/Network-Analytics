### Project background

#### The compound of technologies we use to call 'AI' promises to revolutionize many sectors. However, there is a substantial gap between what firms say they do with AI and what they actually do with it [1]. Several factors could account for such a gap: the adoption of AI tools is costly since it tends to jeopardize an incumbent's operations [2]; there is a shortage of human capital trained in the area of AI [3]; developing AI applcations may require businesses to cope with ethical/societal implications [4, 5] and regulatory issues [6]. In the context of knowledge intensive industries, there is yet another obstacle to the diffusion of AI, namely, 'people.' While some professionals may be thrilled to integrate AI in their daily work, some others may just feel threatened. This FCP deals with the distribution of security traders opinions about the impact AI can make on 'trading floors.'
